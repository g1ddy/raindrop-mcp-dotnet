# Raindrop MCP .NET Integration

[![Raindrop.io Logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/182288589?s=80&v=4)](https://raindrop.io)

**A robust, high-quality Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Raindrop.io API, built with C# and .NET.**

This project provides a bridge, allowing AI models and development tools to securely and intelligently interact with your Raindrop.io bookmarks, collections, and highlights. It's designed for AI integrators, power users, and .NET developers looking to build powerful, context-aware applications.
Once connected, you can interact with the server using natural language. The server also includes pre-built sample prompts to help you discover its capabilities. In many clients, like the Gemini CLI tool, you can access these by typing `/` and selecting a command from the list that appears.
