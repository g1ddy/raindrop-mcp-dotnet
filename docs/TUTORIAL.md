### **Step 1: Choose Your Setup Path**

Before you can use the server, it must be configured. Please select the guide that matches your goal:

-   **For Users (Recommended):**
    If you want to use the server without modifying its code, follow the quick and easy setup instructions in the **[Package README](../../src/Mcp/README.md)**. This guide covers the recommended installation methods.

-   **For Developers:**
    If you want to run the server from source to debug, modify, or contribute to the project, follow the **[How to Set Up a Development Environment](./HOW_TO.md)** guide.

**Once you have completed one of these setup guides, return here to continue.**

### **Step 2: Interact with Your Bookmarks!**

Now for the fun part! With the server configured, you can open the Copilot chat in VS Code and try asking it to perform a task. The agent will use your configured MCP server to interact with your Raindrop.io data.

Here are some examples to get you started:

**Managing Bookmarks**

*   **Find a specific bookmark:**
    > "@RaindropMcp Find my bookmark about 'Model Context Protocol'."

*   **Add a tag to a bookmark:**
    > "@RaindropMcp Find my bookmark about 'Gemini CLI' and add the tag '#ai-tool' to it."

*   **Update the title of a bookmark:**
    > "@RaindropMcp Change the title of my bookmark with id 12345 to 'My New Title'."

**Managing Collections**

*   **List all of your collections:**
    > "@RaindropMcp List all of my collections."

*   **Create a new collection:**
    > "@RaindropMcp Create a new collection named 'AI Research'."

**Working with Highlights**

*   **Add a highlight to a bookmark:**
    > "@RaindropMcp Add a highlight with the text 'This is a key insight' to my bookmark with id 12345."

**Congratulations!** You have successfully set up and used the Raindrop MCP server.
