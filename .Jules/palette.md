**Learning:** When working on a purely backend project (like an MCP server), the "User Interface" is the text and data returned to the AI or developer. Strict frontend definitions (HTML/CSS) don't apply, but UX principles do.
**Action:** Focus on improving error messages, tool descriptions, and user-facing prompts/confirmations. Treat the AI as the user.
